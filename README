Correctly Implemented Aspects:
    readaline.c: This file reads and stores one line at a time from the 
    provided file. It returns the number of bytes in that row to the 
    main function.
    
    dissect.h: This file holds the interface for the dissect function. 
    dissect.c : This implementation file seperates the digit bytes and the 
    non-digit bytes in each row and stores them in seperate char pointers. 
    This function returns the total count of the digit bytes in the row. 

    restoration.c : This implementation file is the only access point the 
    users have and calls all the other functions.  

    conversion.h : This file holds the interface for the conversion function. 
    conversion.c : This file changes all the digits from the P2 file into the
    associated ASCII chars and prints out a properply formated "raw" P5 file.
    Nothing is returned. 

    Valgrind - we are also proud to have no memory leaks in our code. 

Incorrectly Implemmented Aspects: 
    Some parts of oour code could be more modular, ie our main function, 
    but we are still pretty proud of it.

Acknowlegements:
    We went to four or five office hours and discussed our plans and code with TAs. 

Hours Spent:
    We spent 45+ hours on this assignment.
